    <h4 class="title">In this area we will have a nav bar with the links to the pages , the only page we have to worry about right now is the Gallery page , and About page if we have some extra time</h4>
    <h4 class="title">The nav bar will be right aligned next to the title , containing the links as defined in our wireframe</h4>


    <h1>Lorem Title</h1>
    <h4>Please enjoy Lorem Ipsum</h4>
    <p>Whats to be in this section is to be decided , as for a first sprint we can just put three pictures as "highlights" of what they do , instead of the rotating images like in wireframe. That could be implemented over the summer.
      Also we should continue this , atleast the frontend over the summer. We dont gotta treat it like an assignment just that we slowly work on it over the summer because our sem 6 is packed and its better to get annoying shit out of the way. If we even finish it in the summer thats event better so its lightwork for sem6
